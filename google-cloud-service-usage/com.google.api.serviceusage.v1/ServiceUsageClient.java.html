// AUTO-GENERATED DOCUMENTATION AND CLASS.
/**
 * Service Description: Enables services that service consumers want to use on Google Cloud
 * Platform, lists the available or enabled services, or disables services that service consumers no
 * longer use.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;See [Service Usage API](https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/overview)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method
 * calls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated for illustrative purposes only.
 * // It may require modifications to work in your environment.
 * try (ServiceUsageClient serviceUsageClient = ServiceUsageClient.create()) {
 *   GetServiceRequest request = GetServiceRequest.newBuilder().setName(&quot;name3373707&quot;).build();
 *   Service response = serviceUsageClient.getService(request);
 * }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note: close() needs to be called on the ServiceUsageClient object to clean up resources such
 * as threads. In the example above, try-with-resources is used, which automatically calls close().
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The surface of this class includes several types of Java methods for each of the API's
 * methods:
 *
 * &lt;ol&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;flattened&quot; method. With this type of method, the fields of the request type have been
 *       converted into function parameters. It may be the case that not all fields are available as
 *       parameters, and not every API method will have a flattened method entry point.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;request object&quot; method. This type of method only takes one parameter, a request object,
 *       which must be constructed before the call. Not every API method will have a request object
 *       method.
 *   &lt;li&gt;A &quot;callable&quot; method. This type of method takes no parameters and returns an immutable API
 *       callable object, which can be used to initiate calls to the service.
 * &lt;/ol&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;See the individual methods for example code.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To assist with
 * these names, this class includes a format method for each type of name, and additionally a parse
 * method to extract the individual identifiers contained within names that are returned.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class can be customized by passing in a custom instance of ServiceUsageSettings to
 * create(). For example:
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize credentials:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated for illustrative purposes only.
 * // It may require modifications to work in your environment.
 * ServiceUsageSettings serviceUsageSettings =
 *     ServiceUsageSettings.newBuilder()
 *         .setCredentialsProvider(FixedCredentialsProvider.create(myCredentials))
 *         .build();
 * ServiceUsageClient serviceUsageClient = ServiceUsageClient.create(serviceUsageSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To customize the endpoint:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * // This snippet has been automatically generated for illustrative purposes only.
 * // It may require modifications to work in your environment.
 * ServiceUsageSettings serviceUsageSettings =
 *     ServiceUsageSettings.newBuilder().setEndpoint(myEndpoint).build();
 * ServiceUsageClient serviceUsageClient = ServiceUsageClient.create(serviceUsageSettings);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the GitHub repository's samples for more quickstart code snippets.
